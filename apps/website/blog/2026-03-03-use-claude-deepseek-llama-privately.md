Every major AI model today comes with a catch.

Claude wants your email. ChatGPT wants your phone number. DeepSeek wants to know who you are. Even the "open" models require an API key tied to a billing account. Before you can ask a single question, you've handed over your identity.

For a growing number of users, that's the deal-breaker.

## Why People Want AI Without an Account

The reasons vary, but they're all legitimate.

**Professionals with confidentiality requirements** -- lawyers, journalists, therapists, security researchers. If your work involves sensitive information, you can't guarantee that an AI company's terms of service, data retention policies, or response to a government subpoena won't compromise your clients or sources.

**People in high-surveillance environments** -- using AI with an account attached creates a record. In some countries and industries, that record has consequences.

**Developers and researchers** -- you want to benchmark models, test prompts, explore capabilities. You don't want your experimental queries attached to an account that gets analyzed and fed back into training.

**People who just value their privacy** -- you don't owe anyone a justification for not wanting a corporation to read your thoughts.

## The Problem With Current Options

The options that exist today fall into a few categories, each with real limitations.

**Local models** (Ollama, llama.cpp) give you complete privacy. Nothing leaves your machine. But running Llama 4 or anything comparable locally requires serious hardware. Most people don't have it, and even those who do can't run frontier closed-source models like Claude or GPT locally at all.

**Privacy-first AI products** are a genuine improvement over ChatGPT. No conversation logging, strong privacy defaults. But they still require an account, still run on centralized infrastructure, and are limited to their own curated model selection.

**API access** gives you more control, but every API key is tied to a billing account. Your usage is logged. You're still identified.

None of these give you access to the full range of frontier models -- Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen -- without any account, without any identity attached.

## What AntSeed Does Differently

AntSeed is a peer-to-peer network where providers offer AI inference and buyers consume it, without either side needing to identify themselves to a central authority.

When you connect to AntSeed:

**No account required.** You install the client and connect. Nothing to sign up for, no email, no phone number.

**Providers never know who you are.** Your requests reach providers without revealing your identity. The network handles routing anonymously by design, not as a policy promise.

**You get access to every model on the network.** Claude, DeepSeek R1, Llama 4, Qwen, and more. Whatever providers have made available. One connection, all models.

The anonymity isn't a feature that could be turned off in a future terms of service update. It's structural, a consequence of how peer-to-peer routing works.

## Claude Without a Claude Account

This one surprises people. Claude is Anthropic's model. How can you access it without an Anthropic account?

Through AntSeed, providers who have legitimate API access to Claude can offer it on the network. You pay the provider directly (in USDC, at rates set by open competition), and your request reaches Claude without Anthropic ever knowing who you are.

The provider knows a request came in. They don't know it came from you specifically. And Anthropic sees API traffic from the provider's account, not yours.

This isn't circumventing anything. It's the same model as any API reseller, except the reselling happens on an open P2P network with transparent pricing and verifiable reputation, rather than through a centralized middleman.

## DeepSeek, Privately

DeepSeek's models, especially R1, their reasoning model, are among the best available for complex analytical tasks. But DeepSeek is a Chinese company, and for many users that raises legitimate data sovereignty questions.

On AntSeed, you can access DeepSeek R1 through providers running the model locally or through API access, without your requests ever touching DeepSeek's servers directly. The provider you route to handles the upstream relationship. You stay anonymous throughout.

## Llama and Open-Weight Models

Meta's Llama models are open-weight. Anyone can download and run them. That means AntSeed's network includes many self-hosted Llama operators: developers with good hardware, inference farms in low-cost regions, edge nodes optimized for speed.

For Llama, the privacy story is strongest. Providers running it locally means your prompts never reach any third-party API at all. The model runs on their hardware, the response comes back to you, and the whole exchange happens without any company's servers involved.

## TEE: The Highest Privacy Tier

For users who need the strongest possible guarantee -- journalists working with sensitive sources, legal professionals, security researchers -- AntSeed supports Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) providers.

TEE nodes run AI inference inside secure hardware enclaves. Cryptographic attestation proves that the code running inside hasn't been tampered with and that the operator cannot access the plaintext of your requests. Not "we promise we don't log." Mathematical proof.

## Uncensored Models and Becoming a Provider

This is where AntSeed opens up something no centralized platform can offer.

Centralized AI products apply content policies uniformly. Not because the underlying models require it, but because the company running the platform does. The same base model that refuses a question on ChatGPT will answer it freely when run without those guardrails.

On AntSeed, providers set their own terms. That means the network can support model variants that simply can't exist on centralized platforms:

**Dolphin** (fine-tuned on Mistral and Llama) -- one of the most widely used uncensored models, built for full prompt adherence with no refusals.

**Hermes** (NousResearch) -- instruction-following model with strong reasoning and minimal filtering.

**WizardLM** -- fine-tuned for complex instruction following, popular for creative and research tasks.

**Custom fine-tunes** -- domain-specific models trained for security research, red-teaming, medical, legal, or creative use cases that mainstream platforms won't touch.

**Base models** -- raw, uninstruction-tuned weights for researchers who need direct model access without any RLHF layer.

Anyone with a GPU can run these models and become a provider on AntSeed. The barrier is low: download the model weights, run the AntSeed node software, set your pricing and capabilities. The network handles discovery, routing, and payment automatically.

A developer with a gaming PC running Dolphin or Hermes locally can earn USDC for inference that would be refused or banned on every major platform. Their cost is electricity. Their market is every AntSeed user who needs unrestricted model access.

TEE nodes and uncensored models often go together. Maximum privacy and maximum model freedom in the same provider. For users in sensitive professions or with legitimate research needs, that combination doesn't exist anywhere else.

## The Practical Picture

Getting started takes one command. Your existing AI tools -- Cursor, Claude Desktop, or anything that supports OpenAI-compatible APIs -- work without modification. You point them at AntSeed instead of the original endpoint, and the network handles the rest.

You choose your providers based on the model you want, the price you're willing to pay, and the privacy level you need. The network shows you reputation scores, pricing, and capabilities. You pick. The rest is automatic.

No account. No identity. Just the model.
